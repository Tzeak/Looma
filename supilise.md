###Questions
* Open module - server needs to give front end 1. an object with ALL object ids for each lesson plan (so we can list them all), and once the user selects the lesson plan she wants, the server needs to give front end 2. an array of object ids of each piece of content in this lesson plan
* Open a saved lesson plan in edit mode - talk about how front end team should go about that for now
* How do we read ObjectId in "_id" : ObjectId("554..."), (having trouble because ObjectId is not in quotes, which we expected for a JSON object value
